1151011 by himself in A 13. These consisted of an extract in copy
from Erasmus' account books (in Erasmus' own hand), detailing
the 11100105 deposited with Goelenius3 copies of the receipts given
by (1001011105 for these moines: copies of Goclenius' letter to
Amerbach of 19 Aug. 1530 (Α 3), 311(1 of the relevant portions of
A1nerba‹.·l1's rcply (Α 13). On 2 Dec. he sent a further letter,
explaining details in the letter of 16 Nov.

But before writing this second letter he had received (011
30 Νον., Α 10) two letters addressed to him on behalf of Gocle-
nius' family3 the one from their legal agent, Altenanus (A (⁷³), the
other from Conrad Heresbaeh (A 11). In reply to these letters he
furnished Altenanus with copies of the documents already sent to
the University, and, in addition, with a copy of the relevant
sentences from Erasmus’ will (A 14). In the letters accompanying
these documents (A 10, A 12) he left Goclenius' family in no doubt
as to his opinion on their claim. He pronounces the donation of
Ep. 2863 to be plainly ‘fictitiousl

From the Acta of Louvain University we know that on 23 July
1540 Goclenius' family still maintained their claim, and proposed
to take it into court. But from that date there is no further
mention of the matter in the University Acta. From a statement
of Peter Opmeer (1526—95) we learn that some 2,ooo ducats of
the monies deposited with Goclenius were ultimately distributed
to the poor (in Brabant) (Opus Chronoqraphicum, i. 476 b); and it
seems certain, therefore, that Goclenius⁷ family were unable to
sustain their contention at law (see Cran. E„ pp. 248—9).

The interpretation given to Ep. 2803 by Amerbach and the
Louvain authorities undoubtedly represents accurately what was
understood both by Erasmus and Goclenius. The deed of acknow-
ledgement written by Goclenius on 17 Sept. 1533 (A 1) was plainly
written immediately on receipt of Ep. 2803. 11 15 written pri-
marily to provide for the unlikely contingency of his dying before
Erasmus—in that contingency the monies are to go back to
Erasmus. It 15, 35 110 03115 11, a kind of ‘last will ⁷. Taken alone,
however, it does not help the contentiori that the donation was
ί1101111005 ’. The Memorandum drawn up by Erasmus on 8 April
1534 (A 2) is more helpful. It at least makes it plain that Erasmus
himself regarded the donation as fiduciary z and there is no doubt
that the monies spoken of in it are the total of the three deposits
enumerated by Goelenius in Ep. 2352. Erasmus could not have
written the Memorandum if he considered himself already, by
Ep. 2863, to have disposed of these monies by a free and irre-
vocable gift. The Memorandum and (as Amerbaeh points out)
Erasmus’ will, put Erasmus’ intention beyond doubt. He was
trying to create a trust—his trouble was that he was doing so in
conditions prior to a law of trusts. Goelenius' correspondence
with Amerbach, again (Α3 and Α13), proves that, at least in
1536, Goelenius regarded himself as a trustee—in particular, the
penultimate paragraph of his letter shows tha-t he interpreted
his office as trustee even more rigidly than Amerbach. His three
years' delay in executing his trust remains difficult of explanation.
