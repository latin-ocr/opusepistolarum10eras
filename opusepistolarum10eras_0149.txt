2728. To ι101111 CHOLER.

Zofingen MS. P. 14. 1. 9 (α). <Freiburg.>
Olidss. 110093ῑ3 02. p. 246: Lond. xxx. 59: 5 October 1532.

[An original letter, autograph throughout, but written rapidly, so that it
is sometimes difficult to read: preserved with Ep. 2906 10 the collection of
autographs formed by the Protestant theologians, WVolfgang Museulus
(8 Sept. 1497—30 Aug. 1563) and his son Abraham (1534—1591)‚ at Berne,
finally arranged and bound up in two volumes by Abraham's son Wolfgang
(born in 1556) 10 Jan. 1620, and now in the Town Library at Zofingen in
Canton Aargau (P. 14. 1 and 2). The address-sheet is missing, but the head-
ing given by Merula in Ol no doubt represents its content; for the connexion
with Ep. 2814 makes it probable that this letter was written to Choler.

Other letters in the Musculus volumes (2. 51, 1. 142, 2. 58) show how the
letters came to Merula and account for the numerous errors in the text of Ol.
The celebrated Leiden antiquary, Bonaventura Vulcanius (30 Jan. 1538——
9 Oct. 1614), 300 of Erasmus' friend (cf. Ep. 2460, introd.), after spending
some years in Spain, matriculated at Basle in 1575—6; and from there wrote
on 8 Nov. 1576 to Abraham Musculus, offering to communicate an unpublished
Consultatio of Cassander, which he possessed in autograph. In a postscript
he added z ‘ Si quid praeterea Epistolarum Erasmi nancisci potes, rogo te vt
nobis communices. Passim enim conquirimus alias. vt in vnum volumen
redigamus. Quam ad rem D. Gryneus et 'Frobenii me iuuant.' With this
request Musculus complied, and on 2 April 1577 Vulcanius sent the letters
back ε ‘ Redeunt itaque ad te veluti postliminio Erasmi et Philippi epistolae :
quas vt tu merito inter κειμήλια habes, ita ego eas diligenter transcribi curaui,
editurus aliquando cum aliis quas habeo et Friburgo expecto, si typographum
inuenero'. In 1578 he returned to Leiden as Professor of Greek; and in
1606, when the Vita Erasmi (Ol) was in hand. he contributed the letters
which he himself had collected (see Merula's prefaceS, Ol. ff. *Q *ssvol 11. is
easy to suppose that when he borrowed the Mss. from Musculus, the address-
sheet of this letter was extant: but that before the volumes were bound up
in 1620, it had disappearcd. Evidently his copyist was neither skilful nor
accurate; and Merula himself no (loubt never saw the originals. For other
mss. collected by B. Vulcanius, see Epp. 17 introd.‚ 1485: why the latter was
not printed by Merula in Ol is not clear.

I have not been able to trace how the originals passed from Choler's hands
into the Musculus Collection. P. S. A.]
