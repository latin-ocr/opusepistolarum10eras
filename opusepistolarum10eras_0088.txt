tamen adhuc contigit per quem illi rescriberem. Quid illic venetur

Alciati fortunam doleo, qui toties cogitur vertere solum.
Scripsi Georgio Paumgmtnero, et Ioanni Chrysostomo. Francisco

Cum Anselmo Ephorino tibi conuenire gaudeo. Quid Hcrmano
nostro acciderit? iam sesquiannus est quod nihil scribit, οὐδὲ γρῦ.
Quid suspicer, iam tibi significaui, nec puto me falli.

Vale.

2682. 64. Scripsi] The letter to
George Paungartner is Ep. 2683;
that to John Chrysostom is not ex-
tant.

Ioanni Chrysostomo] Panfilo
Zanco (1490 '3—1566), son of Paul
Zanco, was born at Bergamo, of an
ancient family. Becoming a canon
regular in 1524 he took the names
John chrysostom. In 1529 he was
sent by his Order to Padua; meeting
there both Bern bo and Viglius (Bembo
he had already known in Bergamo
where Bembo's father had been
‘ podesta'). Four years later he
moved to Ravenna (see Ep. 2885). On
25 Feb. 1536 Viglius addresses a letter
to him at Ravenna, VZE p. 206:
from a letter of Aretinus (and from

- Zanco’s reply) we know that he was

still there in 1540 (Aret. Epp. 1 1. 150).
In that year he was appointed Prior
of the Holy Spirit at Bergarno. In
1559 he became General of his Order,
dying seven years later in his native
town. In, or before, 1536 he pub·

lished his Ad Carolum v Imperatorem
paneyyrz’cus (s. a.) (VZE l.c.). In 1541
he printed at Venice, and dedicated
to Bembo, his principal work De
Orobiorum siue Cenomanorum oriqine
situ ac Beryarni rebus antiquis libri
iii. He wrote also a number of Greek
and Latin verses, which he did not
print. In 1532 he sent an elegy on
the death of his father, with other
poems, to Viglius, who passed thern
on to Logus (Brussels MS. II. 10401‚
f. 43). Tiraboschi³vii‚ c. i, sect. xxx.

65. Rupilio] See Ep. 2867 introd.
which shows that Erasmus did not
fulfil his promise of writing until
Sept. 1533.

66. Hermano] Haio Hermann
Phrysius (see Ep. 903. 12n). Erasmus'
most recent letter to him, Ep. 2261,
was dated 31 Jan. 1530. For Eras-
mus’ suspicions cf. Ep. 2587. 85-8.

2683. 2-3. prouocauit] See Ep.
3602.

9. literis] No letters of J. G. Paun-
gartner to Erasmus are extant.
