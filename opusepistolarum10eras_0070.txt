38 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1532

His acceptance of the Lutheran doctrine of salvation by
saith brought on him the attacks of the catholic theologians‚ in particular of
J. Hochstrat. He answercd them by his Verantwortunq . . . auff die
Beschuldunq des leeoloyen, διας but his books were confiscated and the Abp.
of Cologne‚ Hermann of Wied, enjoined him to keep silence. He defended
himself against further attacks by no sewer than 7 painphlcts. In Ein ser
natzliche Warnunq wider alle List des· Teuffel& vml seiner salsclwn I'rophctcn
he describes thc threats uttcrcd against him from the pulpits of Cologne.
Two of the books attacking hini were issued under the narne of Cochlaeus:
Eyn warhafftiye Christeliche stroffuny eynes Buclzlins dem hochqebornen ‘cml
yeystlichen lcern Dutsch Ordens ron lsenburq zu yeschrieben and Eyn φημί
nutzlich vermanuny Ioannis Coclei Doctor in der heyliyen yeschryfft tzu aller
srommen . . . Christen‚ διο. But he refused to believe that Cochlaeus was
the author of these works. In 1529 hc. publishcd Ablenunq der vnchristlichen
straff, so die prediyer ΜοηςΙι :u Collem, uncrfinclclich aus yltrem Sophistischcm

qemun, &c. This was his last publication.
of Cologne : ‘ der ding niussig zu stain ’.

Agrippa in his Apol. adu. leeoloyistas Louam'enses (Agr. Op. ii. 278)
refers to Isenburg: ⁶ Nonne generosus Dominus Gulielmus ab Isenberg, licet
homo laicus, et nullis scholasticis disciplinis imbutus, occlusit ora Theolo-
gorum Coloniensium et ad deprecandum vlteriorem disputationem adegit ’.
In March 1532 Hedio dedicated to him translations from Augustine. This
letter from Erasmus is the last trace of Isenburg. Krafft, pp. 203-7, gives
a bibliography of his writings; see also ADB. xiv. 622.

Schreiber, Gesch. Univ. Freiburg), ii. 105 mentions a count of Isenburg who
was a ⁴ Tischgenosse' of Erasinus, and had difficulties about inatriculating
at the University. For two members of the Isenburg family, see Ep. 2298,

which belonged to Erasmus, now in

is a Venetian ‘Langdolch' (Major,
Plate 22). Dr. A. Hartmann informs
us that* this bears no ‘ elogium ⁷.

J. Poppenruyter sent a ‘ gladiolus'
as a gift to Erasmus in return for
Erasmus' gift of the ‘ Enchiridion'
(see Ep. 1556. 42—8). For a dagger
sent as a gift of compliment Dr.
Hartmann cites a letter of John

citizen of Basle, has sent a dagger to
the Regent of the 'Collegium Bur-
gundiae' in Paris, where his son and
the Amerbachs were studying. ‘ Nos
volebamus in communi soluisse, sed
ipse solus exoluit; non voluit, vt
