28262846 FROM DAMIAN A Gosss.

Leipzig MS. Antwerp.
EE. 188. 20 June 1533.

[An original letter, autograph throughout.

Damiano de Goes (1 501—74)‚ a Portuguese of noble family, born at Alemquer,
was brought up as a page at the court of King Emanuel. In 1521 King
John 111 appointed him one of the commercial agents of the Portuguese
government in the Factory of Antwerp ; his duties took him to many parts
of Europe (see ll. 8-14, 42). In the Netherlands he made acquaintance with
the leading humanists, some of thern near friends of Erasmus. Cornelius
Grapheus· printed in 1531 a poem Pictura seu Descriptio Damiamss, in which
he speaks of himself as teaching Latin to Damian. In 1532 he published
his Leyatio maynt Indorum Imperatoris Presbyteri Ioannis ad Emanuelem
Lusitaniae reycm AD. MDXIII (Antwerp, Grapheus). The book was trans-
lated into English by John More, London, W. Rastell, 1533. Damian left
a copy of his Leyatt’o with Erasmus, to whom. in 1533, probably in the spring,
he paid a visit at Freiburg, bringing with 111111 an introduction from Rescius.
His correspondence with Erasmus forms an interesting part of the letters of
Erasmus' last years. In June 1533 the King appointed him ‘quaestor India-
rum orientalium', and he was recalled to Portugal. Erasmus had in 1527
dedicated his chrysostomi Lucubration& to John 111 (Ep. 1800) ε but the pre-
face contained some indiscreet remarks on the Portuguese Faetory at Ant-
werp ; and when Goes set out for Portugal in 1533, Erasmus wrote begging
him to convey his apologies to the King (Ep. 2846. 165—70). Goes was himself
rich and noble; and before leaving for Portugal he sent Erasmus the gift of
a fine silves-gilt tankard (l. 6911). But Goes retained his new appointment
only for a short time; he had resigned it before 13 March 1534 (Ep. 2916. 19-
20) and was in Antwerp again in the spring of that year. He had made up
his mind to abandon administration, and to study eivil law in Italy. On his
way to Italy he. wished to pay a second visit to Erasmus (cf. Ep. 2919). He
was in Basle on 17April (Basle MS. G. Π. 13, f. 157), and seems to have reached
Freiburg before 23 April (Ep. 2024), bearing flattering offers from John 111
(see MHL¹²‚ p. 616). Erasmus would have been glad to have him as a per-
manent ‘conuictor' (Lond. xxx. 69, LB. 1279). It was doubtless on the
occasion of this visit that Erasinus composed for Damian⁷s use the small
treatise entitled Corripendz‘um RIretorices, printed after Erasmus' death, and
against his express wish. by R. Rescius (Louvain 1544); for this treatise see
Appendix xxii. Damian's visit ended on 18 Aug. (Lond. xxx. 66, LB. 1271).
On his way to Italy he visited Bonifaee Amerbach. He carried with him
letters of introduction from Erasmus. By 11 Nov. he was at Padua. where
he intended to study: and had delivered a letter there from Erasmus to
Pietro Beniho (cf. LB. 1259). In Padua in 1536 he learned of Erasinus‘
death, and passed the news to Clenardus (see Clen. E. pp. 56, 70). He took
his degree there in 1538.

Early in the year following he returned to Louvain, where 110 inatriculated
on 4 June. It was his intention to settle there perinanently (BRE. 350);
and between 1538 and 1542 he printed there, with Roscius, several of his
historical opuscula: Commentarii Rerum Gestarum in India citra (lauaem a
Lusitanis anno 1538 (Sept. 1539); Fides, Religio, illoresque Aethiopum sub
irnperio Pretiosz' Ioannis, together with Deploratio Lappianac (lentis (Lou—
vain‚ 1540, repr. Paris 1541); Hispania (1542). ΑΙ] these works, with
miscellaneous poems and letters, were brought togvthor by Roscius in
successive editions of his Damiani Opuscula. But in 154: Louvain was
attacked by French troops. Goes, who undertook to command the student
