2897] To GASPAR SCHETS 347

At the end of the volume is a long poem by Schets‚ in which he speaks of his
dislike of business and his passion for literature. He tells us that not only
his father, but his mother, had throughout discouraged his literary ambitions;
his father had pointed out to him that neither Homer nor Virgil had known
how to make money: before long, however, he hopes to' escape from com-
merce to poetry. On the death of his father he succeeded to the estate of
Grobbendonck‚ to which he added other extensive possess-iens. In 1555 he
was made agent of Philip 11 in Antwerp. From 1564 to 1577 he held the office
of Treasurer Genera] and took a leading part in the politica] life of the
country (see BN. viii. 315). He was familiar with the literary circlos of the
Netherlands; he wrote an elegy on the death of Marcus Laurinus, 154o; in
one of his poems he pays compliments to James ‚Jasparz and on the occasion
of his second marriage he received a congratulatory poem from Nic. Grudius
(Delit. Poet. Bely. ii, p. 561). When in 1552 Sir Thomas Grcsham became
Edward VI's factor in Antwerp he lived for a while in the house of Gaspar
schets, ⁴ his very friend ’. In the hostilities of 1577 Schets' castle of Grobben-
donck, containing his splendid library, was besieged and burnt. He writes
of this to his friend Bucco Aytta, nephew of Viglius Zuichemus; a lct'ter to
him from Viglius himself (Brussels, 3 Jan. 1577> is preserved in Brit. Mus.
MS. Harl. 3421. f. 48v0. In 1579 Schets published a defence of his conduct
of affairs Viri pietate, moderatione doctrinaque clarissimi. Dialoyus de Pace,
rationes quibus Belyici tumultus, inter Philippum . . . Hispanice reyem et sub-
ditos hoc rerum statu componi possint, explicans. This he subsequently re-
produced in a free Flemish version. Letters by him were printed in
quheworpene Brieven van sommiyhe Valsche Patrioten‚ Antwerp, 1580]

ERASMVS ROT. GASPARI SCHETO S. D.

SVMMOPERE gratum fuit, adolescens charissime, quod indolis
doctrinaeque tuae specimen mihi dare volueris. Declarant enim
litterae tuae te arguto ingenio praeditum esse (in quo parentem
vtrumque refers), deinde in vtriusque linguae literatura non in-
feliciter versari, quae res etiam eo nomine mihi fuit iucundior
quod mihi cum optimis parentibus tuis nec noua nec vulgaris
intercedit amicitia, vt illorum commodis non minus gaudere
debeam quam meis. Quid autem homini potest accidere felicius
quam si liberi sese talibus instruant disciplinis vt et suis priuatim
et patriae public[a]e tum vsui tum ornamento csse possint? Pro-
in vt currenti, quod aiunt, addam calcar, etiam atque etiam
hortor, mi Gaspar, vt in ipso pulcherrimo cursu semper te ipsum
superes, donec ad metam perueneris.

Mater nullo nomine mihi obstricta est, in quam nihil vmquam
contuli vel officii vel beneficii, aut si quid contuli, abunde pensa-
tum est. Itaque quando illi occasionem praebuisti vt me gratis-
simo munere donandum putaret, par est vt vicissim meam apud
illam agas vicem, eique quani potes meis verbis gratias maximas
agas, pollicens me daturum operam ne beneficium hoc penes
hominem ingratum videatur esse depositum. Vtinam autem,
sicut misit mundam supellectilem, ita et potuisset et famulam
mundam mittere! Nihil enim hisce mulieribus sordidius. Si
quid illis committitur elegans, tertia lotione perditum est. Ita
torquent, pulsant ac vexant ca quae lauant.

Est mihi vetula deformis, pigra, loquax, edax, maledica. Ausim 2

ego hanc vnam quindecim mulieribus opponere. Vixit tamen
mecum annis iam fere duodecim. Nemo suadet-vt mutem: fore
