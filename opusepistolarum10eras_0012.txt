many hazards bore them into ultimate safety. Now both 116 611(1

lived to see’ 11113. But even of that we have no assurance: we
should be glad to know that they are in safety. The help given to
us by Dr. Roersch has been of great importance. In particular we
have to thank him 101 sending us a photograph of the newly dis-
covered original of Ep. 2512, and 101 bringing to 0111 notice the draft
of a letter of Leonard de Gruyeres which answers Ep. 2397. The war
