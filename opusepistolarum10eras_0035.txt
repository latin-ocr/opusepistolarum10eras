2636] TO JAMES CANTA 3

pulcherrimo instituto, quo conaris studia iam apud plerosque
nescio quo malo fato refrigescentia excitare, et ad id vnum omnes

fortunas tuas, omne studium industriamque conferre. Quae res 5

mihi persuadet te non solum virum bonum esse verumetiam animo
generoso praeditum. Quod si literae quae nunc apud plaerosque
languent emoriantur, quaeso quid erit haec vita nostra, aut quid
sperandum, nisi vt in Turcicam barbariem degeneremus ‘l Vt
approbo summopere conatum tuum, ita precor vt Christus Opt.
Max. quod agis bene fortunare dignetur. Oro vt posthac Erasmum
in amicorum tuorum album ascribere digneris. Reuerendissimo
Cardinali Campegio meis verbis salutem dicito reuerenter. Scio
quantum illi debeam, et debeo profecto libenter, et plura debere
cupio. Eram occupatissimus, sed hoc tempusculi suffuratus sum
vt te salutarem, nactus hunc iuuenem tui amantissimum, quicum
lubens egissem de conuictu, nisi tam commodum haberet dominum.
Nulla re mihi magis est opus quam fidelibus ministris, sed haec
alea mihi non semper eadit vt volo. Bene vale.
Apud Friburgum Brisgoiae Anno a Christo nato M.D.xxxn.

26372701 FROM ἱ101111 GENESIUS SEPULVEDA.

Sepuluedae Epistolarum Lib. 7, 1557, f0. A. Rome.
Sep. E. p. 77. 1 April 1532.

[Juan Gines de Sepulveda, 1491—1572, was born at Pozo Blanm, near
Cordova, and educated, first at Cordova and Aleala, subsequently (1518—23)
at the Spanish College of Bologna, to which he was preferred by Ximenes.
In 1521 110 published Rerum Gestarum Acyz'di'i AIbornotii, appending to it a
Breuis Bononiensis Colleyii Hispanorum descriptio (Bologna, J. de Benedictis),
a book several times reprintcd and translated into both Spanish and Italian.
He translated the Parua Naturalia of Aristotle (Bologna 1522), and the De
qeneraeione. and De mundo (Rome, 1523). In 1523 he printed at Rome the
Dialoslzcs (Ie appetenda (floria qui inscribitur Gonsalus. During his last two
years at Bologna he paid several visits to Albertus Pius at Carpi; and in the
summer of 1523, removing his nanic from the books of the Spanish College, he
attached himself 101110 service of that prince. He seems to have accompanied
Albertus to Rome in 1525 ; where 111 1110 year following he published Dc sato
ec libero arbitrio libri tres, quo in opere . . . domna sslartini Luthcri . . . con-
sulatur, a book which Erasmus mentioned in the Ciceronianus as possessing
⁵ promise ’. While adiniring the Ciceronianus, Sepulveda did not much like
this patronizing reference to the work of one who was 110 longer a boy and
had spent 8 years in Italy. In 1527 appeared (Rome, Marcellus Silver) his
edition of the Commentary of Alexander Aphrodisiensis ‘in xii Aristotelis
libros de prima philosophia ' (translated into Latin). ()n the sack of Rome in
1527 110 went with the cardinal of Gaeta, Thomas de Vio, to Naples: 11111
returned shortly afterwards to Romo, entering the household of Cardinal
Quignon. His service with Quignon brought him into connexion with 1110
Eniperor's court (see App. xv. vol. iv, p. 622), and in 1520 110 printed at
Bologna his Ad (erolum Γ Imperatorem inuictism'mzmz vt . . . bellum suscipiat
in 'Furcas . . . cohortatio. In 1531 he published at Rome Dc riti! nuptiarum
εἰ dispensatione libri tres (reprintcd l’nris 1541, London 1553), 111 which he
argued for the validity of Henry V111’s marriage with Knthnrine. In «11111.
1520 Albertus Pius had printed in Paris his Responsio I'araenetica (see lep.
1034 introd.), which in March of the same year Erasinus nnswered with a
0011111οΓ Responsim following it with a furt her Apologlia 111 1531. 111 nnswerto
this A poloyia Sepulveda wrote his Antapoloyia pro Albvrto I'io in lsi-asumma.
printed first 111 Romo hy Bladus. 1532, and then in Paris 1»)- Augurellus,
22 March 1532. The Romo edition he sent to Erasinus with 1110 present
lcttcr; Erasinus had, however, already seen the Puris edition (see lep. 2701).
