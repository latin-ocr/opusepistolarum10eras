AN. 111. 15. What would appear to
be the first draft os the will of 1536
(in Bonisaee Amerbaeh's hand) is at
Bas-le, MS. I'rk. 11³4. dated ‘nonis
Iuniis 153b' (Iuniis ina)⁷ be an error
for Ianuariis, or 1536 sor 1535).
W'hen Erasmus moved from Basle in
'1529 110 was apparently doubtful
whether the will made there would
have validity 111 Freiburg. At any rate
he secured lieenees from King l-'erdi-
nand and from the Emperor (Epp.
2317.S). That he was about to make a
new willin 1531appearsfrorn Ep.2490.
123 but the present letter indicates
that he did not carry out his inten-
tion. In April of this year he tells
01311 that he proposes to remain in
Freiburg throughout the winter, ‘ sed
eondito testamento quod Basiliae
‹·on(li‹leram'‚ Ep. 2792, ef. Ep. 2860.
20—31. In August he writes to Boni-
faee of the difficulties which he finds
in exeeuting his will, Ep. 2865. 9-11.
Nine days later he writes to Choler
(Ep. 2808) that the matter of the
will is not going to eause difficulty.
At the beginning of 1534 he either
drafted or exeeuted a will: ¹ condidi
testamentum' he writes to Olah, Ep.
2898 (23 Jan.). Of this will, if exe-
euted, neither the original nor any
eopy has survived. Ι
