[The date is confirmed by comparison of ll. 10-17 with Epp. 2776. 27-57,
2800. 22-8, and by what is said of Quirinus.

Eustace Chapuys (†1556) was born at Annecy. After taking his doctorate
111 law, he entered the service of Charles 111 of Savoy. In 1517 he was ap-
pointed Official to John Francis of Savoy, bishop of Geneva. In Agr. E.
726-8 (16 Nov. <1517>) he is mentioned as being in residence at Gcncva and
anxious to find employment there for 1115 friend, Cornelius Agrippa. Three
letters to Agrippa of 1521 (Agr. E. 786‚7,S) mention him 05 Official of the
bishop of Geneva—in one of them he is spoken of as “Sabaudiae sydus ac
decus’. Among the letters to Agrippa is 0110, Agr. E. 701), dated merely 1522,
which appears to be written by Chapuys. In it 110 expresses his confidence
in Agrippa, but his regret that 110 (011011055) 15 now obliged to live ‘pro
publico munere populariter, nec tam ex vero quam ex opinione ' ; he states
that in the previous year he had been ‘ stung by a nettlc’ and had been in
exile and in great fear; suffering public and private damage. What this
temporary disgrace was we do not kno'w. He seems 10 have continued to
act as Official 10 John Francis' successor, Peter de la Baume. He was later
employed by Charles of Bourbon, who sent him to Spain 011 0 1111551011 10 1110
Emperor. In 1527 the Emperor appointed him councillor and Master of
Requests and in 1529 sent him as ambassador to England. He remained in
England (with a brief absence 1539—40) till 1544—his diplomatic activities are
illustrated by a vast mass of correspondence printed in Brewer, vols. iv 10 xx.
In 1545 he went to Belgium3 letters froin Gravelines, Bourbourg, Α11011005,
Louvain, speak of continued diplomatic activity in spite of ill-health. 111
May 1548 he founded, by permission of the Emperor, the College of Savoy in
Louvain. In connexion with his college he also founded at Annecy a grammar
school for boys, He died 21 Jan. 1556 and was buricd in his college; the
endowments of which were added to by his will made in 1551 (500 ΜΗΙᾺ.
p Agr. E. 972-5, 986-93, 996—7, contain correspondence between Chapuys and
Cornelius Agrippa, in which Chapuys urges Agrippa to write in dcfence of
Queen Katharine. In 1532 there was printed at Luneberg and dedicated 10
Chapuys the pamphlet on the divorce, Non esse, variously attributed to
Agrippa, Vives, and Pulleo (500 MHL⁴. pp. 37 sqq). That Agrippa wrote
the pamphlet seems doubtful. though 111 Agr. E. 1024 (2Clirist11ms 1532,γ cf.
Agr. E. 1055),110 10115 Quccn Mary that he has undertaken the tas-k. To
Chapuys was dedicated Agrippa’s Querela super calumnias (50111 to 1110 pres-s
towards tho end of 1532. Agr. E. 1014).

Chapuys held varibns ecclesiastical benefices. He was in his curly years
canon of St. Peter's at (Jencva and then dean of Viry. Later 110 became
commendatory abbot of 81. Angelo in Sic.ily; see MHD. p. 37.
