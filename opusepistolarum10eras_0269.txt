2816. FROM JACOPO SADOLETO.

Sadoleti Epistolae, 1550, p. 109. Carpentras.
LB. 1250. 9June 1533.

[The date is confirmed by the mention of the Symbolum, which Boniface
sent to Sadoleto on Erasmus' instructions in April 1533, see Ep. 2775 introd.
The Declarationes had been sent similarly in Sept. 1532. see Ep. 2765. 3n.
This letter is one of many concerned with Sadoleto's Commentary on the
Epistle to the Romans. Sadoleto first speaks of his project in Ep. 2648,
mentioning Froben as a possible printer, and indicating that he would attach
value to Erasmus’ judgcment of the book. In Ep. 2805 Erasmus tells Boni-
face that Sadoleto has sent the book for him to comment on, and would like
to have Amerbach's criticisms also. Having forwarded his own criticisms, of
which he received no immediate acknowledgement, Erasmus was apprehen-
sive of having given offence to Sadoleto. In April 1534 he tells Boniface of
his apprehensions, forwarding through him a further letter to Sadoleto (see
Epp. 2927,8)‚ a letter which was either lost or delayed. Early in May
Boniface writes to Erasmus that he has himself been troubled by Sadoletos
silence, but thinks it may be explained by the unreliability of the posts,
Ep. 2931. 1—8. On 31 Oct. Erasmus wrote to Sadoleto, once again expressing
his uneasiness (Ep. 2971). This letter was duly forwarded by Boniface
(Epp. 2972, 2978); but on 28 Nov. (Ep. 2980) Erasmus is still persuaded
