2867. To FRANCIS RUPILnrs.

De Praeparatione p. 153. Freiburg.
N. p. 1087: Lond. xxvii. 20: LB. 1265. 8 September 1533.

[The letter answcrs a letter, not extant, in which Rupilius, at the instance
of Choler, had supplied Erasinus with particulars of the l'aungartner family
(es. Ep. 2808). This information, with additions supplied by Choler‚ Erasmus

’ made use of in his letter to John Vcrgara (Ep. 2870).

Fran‹·is Rupilius ⁶ Germanus natione ' (VZE. p. ¹29) was educated at Vienna.
He studied law under Alciati at Bourges froin 1523-30: where he was
intimate with Viglius Zuichemus and Charles Suoquet. Hoynck I. 1, p. 74:
from a letter written to him by Viglius in 1530, ΥΖΕ. p. 29. it is clear that
he was an older man than Viglius‚ who seems to regard him as his teacher.
In 1530 he wenti to Rome, where he taught and practised—among his pupils
were two sons of John Paungartner: while in Rome he became canon of
Ratisbon and of Brixen (EE2. 125)-—these canonries he owed to Paun-
gartner. In 1536 he was at Padua with Paungartner's sons (VZE. pp. 195,
220). Nic. Freigius in the preface to vol. iv of Zasius’ Opera mentions,
together with Paungartner's sons. Zasius⁷ son. John L'lrich, as having been
taught by Rupilius. Zasius in the preface to his In rsus feudorum epitome
tells Paungartner (13 June 1535) that he has been invited to publish his book
by a number of scholars, including ⁸ Dr Rupilius, filiorum tuorum praeceptor ⁹.
From VZE. pp. 31, 220 we learn that Rupilius was one of the interlocutors
in the revised version of Viglius' De institutione iurisconsulti. an unpublished
dialogue. which was never carried beyond the first book. It was to the kind
offices of Rupilius, who recommended him to Mathias Held, that Viglius
owed his appointment as Imperial Assessor in 1535 (Hoynck Ι. 1, p- 74)-
Hoynck prints two letters of Viglius tonRupilius, VZE. pp. 29, 181, together
with a fragment of another letter, Hoynck I. 1. p. 130. An early letter of
Rupilius to ι1030111111 Vadian. 28 April 1514. from Bruck a. d. Mur, is printed
in VE. 35. Five letters of Rupilius to Nausea. written between Jan. 1535
and March 1536. 311 from Rome, are printed in NF.. pp. 156-7, 161, 164, 178.
These show Rupilius in close touch with P. F. Vergerio and de Gumppen-
berg. EE2. 125 shows that Erasmus had recommended Rupilius to de
Gumppenberg. 111 Ep. 2682. 65 Erasmus sends greetings to Rupilius and
promises to write]
