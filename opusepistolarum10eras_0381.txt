cuiusdam] Herborn. Nicolaus
Ferber of Herborn (1480 ?—1535) was
born at Herborn in Hessen-Nassau;
and rnatriculated at Cologne in 151 2,
when he was already a minorite,
residing 111 the neighbouring mona-
stery of Bruehl. He was appointed
‘ Guardian’ of the Minorites at Mar-
burg; and in 1525 addressed from
that town to Philip of Hesse ‘Eyn
Sendtbrieff durch einen Guardian
Barfusser ordens zu Marburg mit
namen Nicolaus Ferber, An den
Christlichen Fuerstcn Philippen' (the
Christian Prince's answer was printed
with the letter). In the year follow-
ing 110 attended the Synod of Hom-
berg, where he engaged ineffectively
in controversy with Lambert of
Avignon: publishing in that year
(Cologne, Quentel) his Assertzssones
326 verae orthodoxae aduersus Fr.
Lambertzss paradosca impia, in Ilomber-
qiana Hessorum conqreyatione propo-
sita, and Assertiones aliae quibus
excusatur Guardiarzus Marpurqensis.
Lambert replied in the year following
with an Epistola ad Gelonion-ees ad-
uersus Nicolaum Hcrborn; answered
by Herborn with an Epistola ad
Coloniensem felicissimam vrbem
(Cologne‚ Quentel, 1527). Herborn
seems to have rcsided in Colognc
during most of 1110 next six years,
living with John Rinck (Ep. 2285.
introd.)‚ to whom he addressed, in
1529, his Monas Euanyelicae doctri-
nae. 111 tho same year 110 edited

C'oncordantiae breuiores rerum opti-
marum maqisque memorabilium ex
sacris Biblz'orum libris collectae. In
1530 110 was appointed General Com-
missary of the Franciscans for the
countries this side the Alps (both
office and title were well recognized,
though Erasmus (Ep. 3100) has a
not very plausible story alleging the
Pope's ignorance and contempt for
both). In 1531 he edited Hayrno of
Halberstadt's commentary on Isaiah;
and in 1532 published at Cologne De
perceptione Eucharistiae sententia, ad
Alardum Aemstclredanum (printed
with Alard's Parasceue; for which
see Ep. 433 inti-od). In 1533 he
printed with Hillen at Antwerp 1110
book of Sermons of which Erasmus
complains in this, and many other
letters. VVhether any copies of the
first edition of this book are extant
seems doubtful; and Erasmus' letter
to Carondelet (Ep. 2899) certainly
prevented dissemination of it in the
Low Countriesoeee EE2. 135). But
it was reprinted at Paris (Berthelin)
in 1543, with the title Erzarrationes
Euanqeliorum per sacrum Quadra-
qcsimae tempus occurrentium, authore
fratre Nicolao Herborn ordinis illino-
rum. reqularts obseruantiae Generalt'
commissario Cismontarw, apud Colo—
niam Ayrippinam declamatae. and
with a dedicatory letter (dated. from
Ypres, 10 Oct. 1532) to Roderio
Fernando, ‘negociator' of the king
of Portugal (there may have been
earlier Paris editions, cf. ΕΗΖ. 135).
In 1534 he published Paracloxa sea
theoloyicae assertiones aduersus neote-
ricos hereticos (Paris, (ἔοι-1110111). He
died in 1535 (EI-32. 135 = Ep. 3053).
