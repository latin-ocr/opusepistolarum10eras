with difficulty, and returned to Louvain in Oct. 1543. It was only after
appeal to the Emperor that he was successful in vindicating himself from
the suspicion of cowardice or incompetonce. He left Louvain, and after
visiting one or two other towns os the thherlandS, returned to Portugal;

Principe D. Joam (John 11); and was thereaster eommissioned to write
a history of the reign of King Emmanuel. The first part of this work,
Chronica do Rei· D. Emanucl, appeared at Lisbon in 1566, 1110 other three
parts in 1506-7. But, like Horaee's Pollio, he found himself treading ⁸ per

charge 01 heresy. His orthodoxy had been suspect at an earlier date3
Rodriguez, principal of 1110 Jesuits, had denouneed him as a Lutheran and
Erasmian; he had spoken against indulgenees and the confessional. He was
arrested by the Inquisition in 1571 ; and on abjuring pardoned. In 1572 he

DAMIANVS DE GOES D. ERASMO SVO S.

VNAS dedi tibi per manus Erasini Scheti literas, ex quibus et
de reditu meo Louanium et de ad<u>entu pueri tui eodem puto
intel<l>exisse te. Is puer nulla quidem ratione potuit induci vt
quacunque mea- vteretur opera, quae verecundia num ab eo an abs

5 tuo iussu profecta sit neseio. Scire tamen te velim et te et tuos
omneis totis nobis eitra verecundiam posse vti.

Mi Erasme, quandoquidem te habeo mihi charissimum, nolo te
caelare fortunas meas. Serenissimus rex Lusitaniae, dominus meus
multo optimus, postquam in eiusdem negotiis perpetuum fere

10 decennium Germaniae Sarmatiae Daciae prouincias eius iussu
peragrauerim, iamque ad Belgas tandem redierim, reuocat me per
literas in Lusitaniam, vt scilieet sim illi primus a thesauris, cum
neque hoo aut quid simile vnquam ambiuerim, ae ne cogitarim
quidem. Quo regis erga me amoris indicio proculdubio amici pos-

15 sunt non iniuria gratulari mihi. Relicto igitur iam Louanio
Antuerpiam migrauimus, inde post dies decem Lusitaniam repeti-
turi, quo si deus ille opti. max. nos incolumes peruenire concesserit,
