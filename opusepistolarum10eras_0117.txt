considerable place 111 Erasmus' correspondenee. In EE. and EE2. he was
unfortunately confused with Quirinus TalesiuS. for whom see Ep. 1966 introd.;
the confusion was removed hy Professor (10 Voeht in Enqlische Studien xl.
1909, 378-81. From the present letter it would appear that he had entered
Erasmus' service in the summer 01 1532 (he may be supposed to be one of
the ‘duo Hollandi' mentioned in Ep. 2644 (3 May 1532)). He was almost
immediately sent to England (01. Epp. 2707. 4-5, 2741. 311, 2759. 4211, 2817.
1790). He seems to have returned 111 November or December, hut in
the spring of the year following was ‹lispatehed on a second journey to
England, from whieh he returned in July (01. Epp. 2799. 13-15, 2813. 17018,
2815. 13-14. 2817. 184-94, 2841-4, 28401, 2848. Iez. 2876.3o-1. Throughout
this period Erasmus seems to have entertained a high opinion of him. 111 a
letter to Utenhove (e. 24 April › 1533 110 speaks of him as · a Dutehman‚ who
could not lie if he wanted to' (Ep. 2799. 14—15); and his trustvvorthiness is
emphasized in Epp. 2728. 55, 2792. 57-9, 2831. 5-6.

Τ110 Freiburg matrieulation register reeords: ‘ 4 Nov. 1533 Quirinus Hagius
ex Hollandia clericus dioe. Traiectensis’ ; and Quirinus perhaps left Erasmus'
service when he became a student 01 the University. In a letter to Schets
of 23 Jan. 1534 (Ep. 2896) Erasmus speaks of him as ‘quondam famulus
meus'; and it is plain that by this time he had begun to mist-rust him—
Sehets is asked to show him no kind of courtesy‚ since he is a double-dyed
‘ susurro'. In Ep. 2906 Erasmus tells Choler that Quirinus is attending the
leetures of Zasius dressed on monies whieh he had aequired in England, and
living with ‘eonsusurrones⁷. Writing to Geo. Agricola 0. April 1534 (Ep. 2918)
Erasmus speaks of a ‘ famulus ’ who has reeently revolted from him, though
he had judged him to be the most faithful of men; he thinks that he had
merely entered his service in order to pry into his seerets. The person
referred to ean hardly be other than Quirinus. Though not named he
seems to be referred to again in two letters to Bonifaee of June 1534 (Q. 89,
90) where the term ‘monstrum' is applied to him: and from a letter of
Boniface (Basle MS. C. vla. 73. 428110.) 1115 offenee would appear to be his
inability to hold his tongue (the expression ‘blatero' used by Bonifaee
eorresponds with Erasmus' ‘ susurro'). In aletter to de Pins of 13 Nov. 1534
Erasmus says that. believing himself to have a faithful servant, he finds
that he has nursed a viper (Nimes MS. 215, f. 109) z and the viper would seem
to be Quirinus. A letter of Goelenius dated 10 Aug. 1535 (Basle MS.
Goelenii Ep. 9) illustrates the reasons for Erasmus' distrust of Quirinus
Goelenius writes that, at a dinner party in Brussels attended by persons 01
importanee, Quirinus had stated that Erasmus had always shared the views
of Oeeolampadius; and that his opinions on religion could not be known from
his writings, but only from members of his household who were privileged to
hear him talking freely. Answering Goelenius (Ol. p. 132) Erasmus speaks
of Quirinus as ⁸ furiosus ' and as ‘ vipera '. He mentions Alardus and Quiri-
nus Talesius as partners in tho 0115011101 done. Quirinus Hagius„ he addS, is

uinanle to hol]d his tongue and he suspects him of having poisoned the mind
