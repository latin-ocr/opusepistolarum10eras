2788] TO BONIFACE AMERBACH 193

Litterae hospitis Anselmi, quas miserat Iacobo quondam meo
κλέπτῃ, diutius apud me heserunt, quod nullus obtingeret cui
committerem. Sed pridem per certum hominem misi ad Ioannem
Paungartnerum. Is omnia curabit diligentissime. Quod illi signi· 40
fices oro, quum erit commodum, addasque meo nomine salutem.

Heruagius nihil agit. Appellor ab episcopis de ratione concio-
nandi, deque aliis. Vix tueor valetudinem, et tot iam annis nullas
mihi ferias dedi. Subornant te patronum, cui vni sciunt me nihil
posse negare. Sic Olpeius per te extorsit litteras in Angliam. At 45
is resedit Antwerpiae supra mensem, diutius mansurus, si inuenisset
fatuos. In Anglia decepit eos quibus fuerat commendatus. Permit-
tam tibi pro Heruagio rogare, modo mihi condones quod illi pernego.
Praefari in tam nobilem autorem, inquo non fecerim operae precium,
mihi turpe fuerit et inuidiosum, iustam autem curam impendere, 50
etiamsi maxime cupiam, non possim. Rursum vale.

2789. To NICHOLAS BORBONIUS.

Borbonii Nugae (1538), p. 149. Freiburg.
10 April 1533.

[The date is confirmed by that of the first edition of Borbonius' Nugae
(Paris, M. Vascosanus, 1533), a copy of which Erasmus' letter acknowledges.
The book was reprinted by Cratander at Basle the same year. When he
published a second edition (Lyons, Gryphius, 1538) Borbonius appended to
it Erasmus' letter; which appears also in Cratander's reprint of 1540.

Nicholas Borbonius (1503—0. 1552), was born at Vendeuvre (Bar-sur-Aube),
the son of John Borbonffls, a wealthy uon-founder, and (Nuyac, 4. 64. 6)
Maria Gallaria. Educated at Paris, where for a while he was, like Erasmus,
an inmate of Montaigu college, he was a pupil and near friend of Tusanus in
the newly founded colleyium trilz‘nyue. The first edition of the Nuqae con-
tains five poems addressed to Tusanus (who furnished commendatory verses
to the second edition). More to the point, it contains two creditable sets
of elegiae verse addressed to Erasmus—‘ nil mortale melos quod modularis
habet '‚ he says to Erasmus. An epigram praises Erasmus' translations
from Lucian. Another compares Erasmus and Budaeus ε

Scis quid ab Hollando Francus, Budaeus Erasmo,

Differat? Hic dictis allicit, ille rapit.
But Budaeus has two poems to himself fullos compliment. Other friends
of Erasmus addressed are Erimus, Grynaeus, Alciati, George d'Armagnac. An
epigram attacks Stunica; another, more scu1·rilous,Beda; two others P. Sutor.
But the poems witness to close relations between the poet and persons whose
reputation was suspect—Erasmus' former friend Carinus. Sturm and Marot.
For a letter of Carinus about Erasmus printed in the Nuqac, see Ep. 920
