23 January 1534.

[A xvie. copy, often incorrect, and in one place (l. 34) indecipherable.
At the foot is added: ‘Originale est Anderlechtae in manibusWellemannorum ⁹.
The same hand copied Ep. 2845, which was also at one time in the Neve
collection.

The copy gives the date 23 die Iunii, an obvious misreading; we have cor-
rected Iunii to Ianuarii. On 11 March Erasmus acknowledges (Ep. 2913)
the receipt from Schets of two bundles of letters, the first of which, received
on 22 Jan. (see Ep. 2896), contained a letter from Schets and one from Gaspar
Schets‚ both of which, he says. he has answered. If the present letter is
dated June. we must suppose that Gaspar Schets had written twice. But
this seems excluded by the whole character of Erasmus' reply. He regarded
the young man s letter of January as a remarkable performance, on which he
compliments the father (Ep. 2913). If he was replying to a second letter, it
would be natural for him to mention, in his reply to G aspar, the earlier letter.
But11.10-13 suggest that the letter he is answering is an early attempt in
Latin composition.

Gaspar Schets (Corvinus), 20 July 1513—9 Nov. 1580, was the eldest son
of Erasmus Schets and was like his father a distinguished financier, who had
important connexions with scholars. In 1535 he accompanied Melanchthon
to Erfurt, where he was introduced to Helius Eobanus (ME. 1350). In 1540
he visited Eobanus at Marburg and the visit was the occasion of some elegiae
verses which Eobanus addressed to him (Farraqines 553); in these he refers to
the previous meeting at Erfurt. In the same year Eobanus dedicated to him
his translation of the Iliad, prefixing another poem, in which he confers on
Schets the name of Corvinus:

Sic etenim doctas sequeris Coruine sororeS‚
(Coniunctum hoc Scheto iam tibi nomen erit).

traced earlier editions of these two
books; the reprints were no doubt
evoked by the new interest in the
exploration of the western world.
