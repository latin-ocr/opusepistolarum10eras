being affinitas). On the subject of these impedimenta, and the papa} power
to dispense, he endeavours to be as inconclusive as possible: ‘Quaedam
dirimunt matrimonium ratum, non dirimunt consummatum. Nonnulla sic
dirimunt, quamuis contractum, vt nec Romanus Pontifex relaxet legis
rigorem. Nonnulla, licet non recte contracta, tamen per eum comprobari
possunt, si velit.’ Cautious as he is not to commit himself, he knew that the
question of the Queen's divorce had already been raised ; and within a year
we find him regrctting the indiscretion of which he had been guilty in the
first part of his treatise: he had resolved‚ he tells More, ‘ nihil tale admi-
scere ’‚ but his pen had run away with him (Ep. 1804. 285—7). He supposes
the Queen to have taken offence. Yet in the section on affinitas. he had
plainly declared for the validity of marriage with a deceased brother’s wife,
pointing out that, under the Mosaic law, it was (where the brother had died
childless) not only approved, but enjoined (LB. v. 63913). In the dedicatory
letter to the Quaen, again, there is a significant reference to the princess
Mary; of whom ‘ quid non expectemus? ’ (Ep. 1727. 25-7)—there was a party
which advised Henry to marry the princess 10 an English noble, and accept
a son of the marriage as 1115 heir. In Sept. 1528 he was still so far opposed
to the divorce of Katharine that he preferred (he tells Vives) the project of
allowing Henry to have two wives (Ep. 2040). This solution (for which there
was recent precedent in the case of the King of Casfflle, Cal. State Papers,
ii. 379) had commended itself at different times both to Henry and to the
Pope (Pollard‚ Henry viii, pp. 206-7), and won later the approval of Melanch-
thon, Bucer, and Capito. But by January 1530 Erasmus had abandoned this
solution; at least he does not mention it among the alternatives which he
puts to Boniface in Ep. 2256. Writing in that month to Boniface, he repeats
what he had said in his treatise about the validity of marriage with a deceased
brother's widow, adding ‘ et intercessit Pontifieis diploma ’. On the question
of ⁶ consent', handled with reserve in the treatise, he takes the view that,
though the marriage was certainly forced on Henry, his Subsequent behaviour,
unlike that of Louis xn, indicates that there was in fact consent. By this
date he regards the project of finding an heir by marrying Mary to an
English noble as politically impracticable—nor‚ he is credibly informed, is
Mary capable of bearing children. The only question left open is whether
Henry's marriage with Katharine may be regarded as ⁶ res . . . dispensabilis
ob publicam tranquillitatem ‘. On this question he invites a legal opinion
from Bonifaee. The narrowing of the issue, and the manner in which the
question is put to Boniface, suggests that Erasmus had been approached by
some one interest-ed in the problem from the point of view of Henry ; and in
this connexion it is to be remembered that, late in 1529, he had been invited
to dedicate to Thomas Boleyn a commentary on Psalm 23 (Vulg. 22), and
had accepted the invitation (Epp. 2232. 2266). Bonisace, in his reply (Ep.
2267), lays it down that, in a marriage duly made, all power of dispensation
has been taken from the Pope ‘nisi magna aliqua iustaque causa diuortium
pro suo iure exposceret'. He is inclined to think that the King’s appre-
hension of political disturbance does not constitute this iusta causa. His
own suggestion would be that Henry should adopt an heir. It 15 110 doubt
in allusion 1ο Ep. 2040 (which Erasmus had been indisereet enough to print)
that Boniface adds that he should prefer bigamy to divorce, if he were a
Lutheran-ten years previously Luther, in the Babylonish Captivz'ty‚ had
pronounced bigamy to be the lesser evil. ‘There is nothing to be done',
Erasmus writes in reply, ⁶ except to pray heaven to turn all things 1ο a good
issue. I grieve that the King should be involved in such a maze' (Ep. 2271.
1-2). Some three years later he takes back most of what he had said, 01
hinted, on the subject of the divorce, in a letter to Viglius: ⁶ This business
has been going on for the last eight years, and 1110 King very properly feels
a great weight on his conscience ι though two hundred doctors have proved
by Scripture and reasoning that his marriage never could have taken placo
under human or <livine law ‘ (Ep. 2810). Said to any 0110 else, what 110 hero
says to Viglius would have been more than sufficient 10 account for 1110
‘ rumours ’ 111 Louvain mentioned in 1110 present letter. His final commcnts
on tho subject are given in a letter 10 Coehlaeus <March 1535* (Ep. 3001),
where he says that if 110 had had Cochlneus' wealth of arguments 110 should
have advised the King against the divorce.
