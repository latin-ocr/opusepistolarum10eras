illius alterius germanice, easque ci perplacuisse‚ et audito testi-

15 Antequam vidissem prenominatum libellum vestrum, quidam
hic reprehendebant eum, dicentes Erasmum in totum permittere
vnieuislue in suo sensu abundare, quam obiectioncm postea me
presente cardinalis optime diluit; certo scio nunc eos futuros
equiores etc. Si scirem do<minationem> vestram adhuc non

ρο habere Quolibetica cardinalis, ego ei mitterem.

Dignitatis vestre seruulus Io. Danielis.

2936. FROM ιῙΟΗΝ CHOLER.

Leipzig MS.
EE. 204.

<Augsburg.>
22 May 1534.

[An original letter, autograph throughout. This letter was to be forwarded
to Erasmus through Paungartner (l. 112), by a messenger due to start on
22 May (Ep. 2937. 1-8). But, when he had written Ep. 2936, letters arrived car-
ried bya tabellarius of Erasmus. Choler seems to havesent Erasmus' messenger
to Paungar'tner and assumed that the messenger would carry to Erasmus both
his own letters and a letter from Paungartner to Erasmus. On 26 May Pann-
gartner in fact wrote to Erasmus a letter (Ep. 2939), in which he says that he
mistrusts the messenger and accordingly is not sending by him the gift which
he proposed to make to Erasmus VVhether Paungartner's letter was dis-
patched by this messenger is not clear. But from Ep. 2947 (24 June) it is
clear that Choler's two letters were not sent—for a month, Choler says,
Paungart-ner had been mocking him with the promise of a messenger, and

2935. 8. alterius germanice] This
should mean Erasmus' letter to the
Pope. But it is difficult to think

nia (vt vocantur) quolibeta Tho. a
Vio, Venice, in aed. Luceantonii
juntae, 1531. It was no doubt the

that Erasmus could have forwarded
to the Pope a German version of his
letter; and it is conceivable that the
words refer to the de Ecclesiae con-
cordia, of which two German versions
appeared in 1533 (Ep. 2852 introd.).
Even so it is not easy to divine why
the Pope should have been interested
in the German translation.

11. litteras cardinalis] Not extant.

20. Quolibetica] Quaestioncs ct om-

appearance of this edition which led
Danielis to offer the book to Erasmus.
We have seen a less full edition, of
1514, Venice, G. Arriuabenus; and
there would seem to have been an
earlier one. The book was reprinted,
Lyons, 1552. The first item in the
book is De comparatione auctori-
tatis Pape, see Ep. 256. 4511. For
the form quol'ibeta see Rashdall's
Medz'eval Universz'tz‘es2, i, p. 478. 211.
