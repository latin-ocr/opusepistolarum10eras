27552756 FROM BONIFACE AMERBAGH.

Basle MS. C. VIa. 73. 193 νυ. <Β11810.>
<1c. 22 January 1533.)

[An autograph rough-draft. The manuscript has three previous attempts
at the letter, all of no importanee. Both year· and mouth-date are wanting,
but tho month-date can be supplied by compurison with Ep. 2756, which 18
plainly an answer to this letter. Τ110 fact. that these letters contemplate·
a visit or migration to Baslo would naturally suggest the year 1535, but 11118
year seems definitely excluded by the fact that throughout January Erasmus
was confined to his bed by an 11111988 which began at Christmas 1534 (890
a letter to P. Tomiozki. Paderborn‚ Jb. f. Phil. xv, 1001, p. 338). 111 1534 he
was similarly ill throughout January. The year 1532 seems exeluded by
Epp. 2597—8: and 1531 by Ep. 2420. By this process of exclusion we 899111
obliged to date the letter as belonging to 1533; 11118 18 consistent with
Ep. 2770, where Erasmus states that he had enjoyed good health throughout
the winter· until the last days of February; and finds support in ΓΖΕ. 38,
where Viglius writes to Choler (10 Feb. 1533) that he has heard that. Erasmus
is proposing to return to Basle. In Ep. 2754 Erasmus tells Bonifaoe that he
is thinking of making a new will; for that purpose he had proposed to go
to Neucnburg in 1531, 890 Ep. 2490. 11-12. The watermark on which Ep. 275‹›
18 written is that employed throughout 1532—3: thereafter it appears only
once, in the letter to Sehets of 1 Juno 1536, Bodl. MS. Lat. Mise. C. zo]
