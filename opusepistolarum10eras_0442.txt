APPENDIX XXIII
THE DONATION TO GOCLENIUS (Ep. 2863)

ΕΡ. 2863 professes to be 3 deed 01 gift, conveying to Goclenius,
pleno iure, all the monies (leposited with him by Erasmus up to
the date of the letter (28 Aug. 1533). Erasmus had left, or made,
deposits with Goclenius on three occasions. (1) In 1521, when he
quitted Brabant, he had left with Goolenius the sum of 450 gold
florins (Epp.1437. 122-40, 2352. 38—40). (2) In May 1522 he had
made, through Hilary Bertulphus‚ a deposit 01 111011ίο3 amounting
in their total value to 330 Rhenish fiorins (Ep. 2352. 41-61). At
a later date, unspecified, he had deposited through Quirinus
Talesius 909 gold Philippics (Ep. 2352. 62-71, 31111 Α2 01 11113
Appendix). In 1539 Amerbach reckoned the value of the monies
for which he held Goclenius’ receipts at about 1960 aurei.

Upon the death of Goclenius these monies became the subject
of a protracted litigation‚ the history of which is in many of
its details obscure. The obscurities which involve it are partially
illustrated by documents preserved in the library of the Univer-
sity of Basle. These documents, fourteen in number, consist of
correspondence between Boniface Amerbach and the University
of Louvain, correspondence between Amerbach and John Alte-
nanus and Conrad Heresbach (representing Goclenius' family),
correspondence between Amerbach and Goclenius in 1536,
memoranda'by Amerbach of documents forwarded by himself to
the University of Louvain and to Altenzmus, and, finally, a deed
of Goelenius (17 Sept. 1533) acknowledging monies received from
Erasmus, together with a memorandum by Erasmus (8 April 1534)
of monies placed on trust with Goelenius. For transcripts of
all these documents, and for permission to print them, we are
indebted to the kindness of Dr. Alfred Η31111131111.1 For conveni-
ence of reference we have numbered the documents A 1—14, and
in what follows they are cited by these numbers,

Goclenius died intestate on 25 Jan. 1539. Immediately on his
death, and pending the arrival of those members of his family
who might naturally claim to be his heirs, the University of
Louvain took possession of his goods, including the monies depo-
sited with him by Erasmus. By his last will, made in Basle on
12 Feb. 1536, Erasmus had directed that the monies which he
had 1011 with Goclenius in Brabant were 10 be expended in Brabant
in accordance with instructions which he had himself furnished
