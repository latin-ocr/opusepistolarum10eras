xxiv ADDENDA

quod addis, de nominibus propriis Germanorum perplacet opusculum. Reddam
vicem, vt ait illo. meritis)

The opusculum spoken 01 is, no doubt, the tractate Aliquot Nomina propria
Germanorum ad priscam etymoloqiam restituta. Per quendam antiquitatis studiosum.
Item breuis interpretatio appellationum partium Germaniae, quodam doctissimo viro
aurore, of which the earliest dated edition known to us is that printed by
N. Schirlentz at VVittenberg in ¹537- But there is an undated edition, printed
at Augsburg by P. Ulhard, whose press was operating from 1528 to 1578.
Professor Fiedler tells us that the first edition he knows in whi‹·h the book is
attributed to Luther is that of 1554; aster which the attribution is frequent.

In the Preface to his book Egenolf says that he had the letter (in Erasmus·
autograph) from John Elias Heder tto whose sons lue at one time acted as
tutor): ίαι’)τένγραφον huius Epi-stolae possidebat supra laudatus Du. Hederus
exemplum, ipsius, magni ipsius inquam Erasmi exaratum manu’. Neither he
nor Heder had been able to trace the letter in any of the printed texts accessible
to them.

Except for the two sentences here given, Egenols's version presente only the
following variants: 6 ὲνύαλον 7 ἐκεῖνος om. 9 ἔνι’.
