2826] FROM DAMIAN A GOES 253
cum tibi in primis tum amicis vberius inseruire et poterimus et ex
animo ad id parati erimus.

Pro tuis in me officiis visus sum mihi extra leges amicitiae
facere, si tibi non indicarem ea quae Louanii de te audiui, presertim
cum causa sit tam ardua et male suspiciosa. Aiunt enim te in
diuortio illo Anglicano consentire. Quod cum audirem non potui
satis mirari, cum scirem me ex tuo ore Friburgi contra audiuisse.
Quare pro mea Virili coepi obstare; ac tandem eo ventum est vt
meis ratiunculis amouerim eorum aduersus te suspicionem. Oro
igitur te mihi significare velis, quid respondendum erit si quando
eiuscemodi nugamenta ad aureis nostras forte peruenerint, siqui-
dem nihil dubito quin (cum in Lusitaniam venerim) inciderit sermo
de te coram rege et de tua in diuortium istud opinione.

Memini me tibi isthic libellum de presbyteri Ioannis suorumque
subdit-orum fide ac moribus obtulisse, in calce cuius est nostra
quaedam exhortatio ad Ioannem Magnum Gothum arehiepiscopum

Vupsalensem de Pilapia siue Laponia‚ Scythicae plagae proui<n>cia

‘ Amice optime 1301111661, tuus Dami-

24. Friburgi] The date of Goes’
first visit to Erasmus is not certainly
known. But the indications seem to
point to March 1533. At the time of
the visit, and for some time after,

Erasmus was ill (Ep. 2846). But he

had been well throughout the winter,
1532—3; see Epp. 2770.1‚ 2776. 65, 2782.
10—11. His illness began in the last
days of February (ib.). Goes’ visit
must, therefore. be later than Feb.
1533. But it was earlier than 10
April 1533: for on that day Schiltaeh
was burnt to the ground: Goes, in
his previous letter (not extant), had
asked for details of this disaster, and
Erasmus supplies these in Ep, 2846.
124. VVriting to BonifaceAmerbach 011
5 May 1533 (Ep. 2805) Erasmus men-
tions a Portuguese who has recently
visited Boniface, and whom Boniface
seems to have found tiresome (moles-
tus). Erasmus says that he was
careful not to give him any letter of
introduction. That this Portuguese
was Goes seems not unlikely; for in
Ep. 2846 Erasmus apologises to Goes
for not having given him an intro-
duction to Boniface. (It is true that,
in Ep. 2840, Erasmus is careful to
assure Goes that Boniface found him
congenial.) Ep. 2805answersaletter
of Boniface which has not survived,
and which may very well be a good
deal prior to 5 May: Erasmus had
not written since 22 March (Ep.
2788: a letter which was delayed in
dispatch till 10 April, when 116

note might equally well belong 10
1533 (where Dr. Hartmann places it)
or to 1534.

31. libellum] Tho Legatio Presbyteri
Ioannis. From Ep. 2840 it appears
that Goes had carried the book to
Freiburg, and left it at Erasmus'
house. W'hen, later, he saw and dined
with Erasmus, Erasmus had not
looked at it, or so much as ascertained
that Goes was the author.

33. Magnum] John Store, whom,
with his brother ombus, Damian had
met on his travels. He was sent as
papal legate to Kiug Gustaf in 1523,
being at that time bishop of Vesteras.
Gustaf wished to have him appointed
to the archbishopric of Upsala‚ in
place of Gust-af Trolle. But. the Pope
(Adrian vl) refused to agree 10 this,
and relations between Sweden and
the Papacy were broken off. In 1527
0161116111 VII made Store archbishop:
but Gustaf then refused 10 allow 111111
111 Sweden. He was consecrated arch-
bishop in 1533, residing in Danzig.
111 1538 116 went to Rome. in order
to take part 111 the forthcoming ecu-
menical eouncil. But he died there
i111544. (See. MHL4. p. 012, n. 1.)

34. Laponia] After 1523 the Swedes
regardedthe region asa purtofSweden.
