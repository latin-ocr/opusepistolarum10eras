[A contemporary copy. made c. 25 Νον. 1532, 111 1110 register of the Delibera-
tions municipales of 1110 Town Council of Besaneon: and now preserved
there in the Town Library. The position in the register leaves no doubt as
to the accuracy of the year-date. The letter was first printed by A. Castam
in the Bet-ue Historique, 1, 1876, p. 125, together with Ep. 2553, which
immediately precedes it in the manuscript. The copyist, possibly Lambelin
himself, gives the following heading: ⁶ Lettres de 11101111101 sieur Erasme de

Rottredan au Secretaire '.
John Lambelin of Jussey had held since 1520 the secretaryship to the

town council of Besancon, and in that capacity had discharged various
missions. One of these took him to 1110 Diet of XVorms. and brought him
into contact with Lutheranism: with the result that 110 became a persistent
opponent and critic of the Cathedral Chapter. A few years later he took
part in t'he movement led by Simon Gauthiot d'Ancier 10 draw the Franche
Cornte into union with Switzerland and away from the Imperial dominions.
On the discovery of this he was suspended frorn his office 26 Oct. 1537, and
was beheaded in the market-placc at Besanqon 12 June 1538. See 1110

S. P. Pridem te rogaui vt 11100 1101111110 magnifico clarissimoque
Senatui gracias ageres pro tam propensa in me beneuolencia ac
litteris honorificentissime scriptis⁷ quod te iamdudum fecisse non
dubito. Hic mercatus sum domum et edificaui maioribus impendiis
quam pro meis fortunulis: ita compulit neccessitas Nondum 5
tamen deposui voluntatem istuc commigrandi. Hec aetas nichil
aliud desiderat quam ocium et quietem. Vt autem sciat magi-
stratus me non leuiter de ea re cogitasse, mitto duas epistolas
Caesaris, alteram ad senatum, alteram ad clerum, quas illi reddes,
si videbitur. Hunc nuncium iam tercium emisi, vt saltem vnum 10
adhuc vas vini veteris huc adferat: qua in rc quaeso illum tuo con-
silio tuaque auctoritate adiutes. Datum est 1111 precium abunde.
Obsecro 10, 1111 Lambeline, vt hoc beneficium pristinis tuis erga
me meritis adiungere digneris. Bene vale cum omnibus tuis charis,
