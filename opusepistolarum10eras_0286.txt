ployed in 1532 011 5 1111551011 10 Venice. In Feb. 1533 he was appointed Papal
Nuncio at the court of Ferdinand. At the date of Erasmus* letter he had been
in Vienna not quite three 1110111115. After the death of Clement V11 he was re-
appointed as nuncio by Paul 111 and employed upon negociatione in Germany
in connexion with the summoning of a Coum-il. On 7 Nov. 1535 he had an
interview with Luther at VVittenberg (see LE. 2337). Luther comments on
the encrgy with which the legate ssew from one partos Germany to the other:
Vergerio thought Luther possessed by a dex-il. In 1536 110 was made bishop
first of Modruss in Croatia and then of Capodistria. But, coming under the
suspicion οῖ’ Lutheranism, he betook himself in 1545 to a voluntary exile in
Mantua and later in Venice. Professing openly the evangelica] doctrines. he
left Italy in 1549 to become a preacher in Switzerland. At. Basle he made the
acquaintance of Boniface Amerbach. 111 1552 he accepted an invitation to
come to England and succeed Bucer in Cambridge. but⁴ he did not carry
out the plan. In 1553 110 settled in Tubingen. where he was supported by
the duke of VVurtemberg. He published there in 1563 Primus tomus operum
Veryerz'i aduersus papatum, of which. however, no second volume appeared.
Among his other writings are several in the vernacular.

A biography of Vergerio was written by C. H. Sixt (Brunswick‚ 1855), which
prints his correspondence (1556—63) with duke Albert of Prussia and gives
a bibliography of his publicationS. 89 items. A more modern biography with
a fuller bibliography is that of F. Hubert. Gottingen‚ 1893. W. Friedensburg
published Vcrgerio's dispatches from Germany Nuntiaturbericlzte aus Deutsch-
land, vol. i, 1533-6 (Gotha 1892 with an introduction)‚ where this letter is
printed, p. 104.] After dealing with other subjects Vergerio says:

VARH sunt vndique rerum motus ac minae, vt· sunt humanorum
consiliorum tumultus, quos Homerus muscarum turmis comparat.
Sed celestis illius artificis incogitabilis sapientia, bonitas et clemen-
tia mihi spem bonam facit fore vt haec omnia vertantur in piorum
lucrum et ipsius gloriam.

Iam hic constans rumor est iam coitam inter regem Ferdinandum
et Turcas concordiam satis equis conditionibus, nempe vt Ferdj-
nandi sit Vngaria, quemadmodum fuit Ludouici defuncti. Euan-

quid Susati‚ longum sit scribere; quid nuper Augustae non dubito
quin iam perceperis. Susati tumultum excitauit Dominicanus
quidam e locis compluribus ob furta profugus. Franc<f>ordiae
