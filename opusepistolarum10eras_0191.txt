ex te quam tu commodiorem tam insigne opus et in tomos diui-
dendi et pro dignitate excudendi rationem arbitreris intelligere:
ad haec sibi, si quid in hoc adnotatum habes, communicari rogat.

Annui co libentius interpellanti quod te adiuuandis prouehendisque 15

studiosis et studiis natum, ct inprimis tam eximio authori fauere
non ignorarem. Quo igitur candore es, vt tuam nobis sententiam
vno et altero verbo significare nc graueris, te etiam atque etiam

rogamus.

Bene vale, clarissime Erasme.

[An original letter. in the Stadtarchiv at Strasbourg, possibly autograph,
as the hand is not that of a convcntional sewetary.

The letter may be dated 1533.

A comparison with Epp. 2202 and 2024! 92—102 makes it plain that it
cannot be earlier than 1532—Cammyngha only delivered Ep. 2202 *post

biennium ⁷ on his return from Italy and Louvain.

It' it had been written in

1532, Cainmyngha could hardly have said nothing of his travels and recent

home-coming.

It is obviously prior to Ep. 2866 (Ζ Sept. 1533).]

S. P. Tabellarius quidam nuper Louanio ad nos rediens M.

quandam epistolam ad me inter tabellarios herere tuam. Dii boni,

was followed (within a few days) by
two letters from Hcrwagcn himself

as though he (Erasmus) had agreed
to father the undertaking, and asking
him to write a Preface. He answered
Herwagcn on or before 22 March.

It would bo impropcr for him, ho
adds, to write a l'rcfaco ‘in tum

real editorial work on the book. See
also Ep. 2805. 1-5 (5 May), which
suggests that Herwagcn was still
importunate. Erasmus’ roluctauce
to do anything more with Cicero (ho
had edited tho De Officiis, De Ami-
citia. De Senectute, the Tusculani
Disputations. and thc I'aradoxa)
was, no doubt. dne in part to tho
fact that Scaligcr’s book had ret-cntly
revived the agitation over tho Cicero-
munus.
