2763. To ERASMus SCHETs.

British Museum MS. Add. 38512, f. 76. Freiburg.

7 February 1533.

[An original letter, autograph throughout. This letter would seem to
have been sent hastily by another messenger, two days after the dispatch
of Ep. 2761, in order to forward a letter to More, which has perished—
Ep. 2211, of 5 Sept. 1529, is Erasmus' last extant letter to More]

S. P. Nihil succensui de non missa pecunia, sed verebar ne
tibi quid accidisset quod nollem, imo velim vt eam pecuniam
serues adhuc apud te, donec aliud scripsero.

Ioannes Molendinus scribit te dixisse mihi conuenire cum Bar-
birio. Imo nunc me plane deridet, et cum illo colludit Molendinus
ille. Galli et theologi sunt ambo.

Rogo vt hanc epistolam cures bona fide perferendam ad Thomam
Morum quam potes celerrime.

Admonui et iterum admoneo, cura ne quid litterarum mearum
quas mittam in Angliam, veniat in manus Bebellii. Artifex est
mlrus.

Isti Benedictino qui iam per ocium bis ad me scripsit, non video
melius consilium quam vt se fortunae suae accommodet, nec sibi
mea causa conciliet inuidiam. Mutare vestem hoc seculo est
Luteranum esse: id tamen facile concederet Pontifex, si adole-
scens inductus est in laqueum et habet vnde viuat. Certe meum
non est istam inuidiam in me accersere, quasi quenquam euocem.
Optimum est vt se necessitati accommodet.
alios agat suum negotium. Si volet ipse Romam ire, pro octo
ducatis impetrabit, aut a legato quopiam. Si quid illi responde-
rem, excitaret et sibi et mihi nouam tragoediam. Rursum vale.

In Ep. 2799. 28 Aleander is called
Gallus, though Erasmus commonly
speaks of him as a Jew.

14. Benedictino] Erasmus wrote to
him c. April 19; see Ep. 2793 (from
which it would appear that he was
in the Netherlands). In Ep. 2874
Erasmus warns Justus Decius that
he and his other Polish friends should
have nothing to do with a fugitive
monk representing himself as enjoy-
ing the favour of Erasmus. He may
conceivably be the Benedictine here

dictine who had escaped from his
monastery and presented himself at
Rome with forged letters from Eras-
mus to Bombasius and Pope Leo.
The Pope had received him with open
arms and promises of assistance:
but he had died before these could
materialize. (In Ep. 2798 he tells
the same story to Chapuys, with a
general warning against any ‘erro’
who may use Erasmus* name in order
to impose on him.)
