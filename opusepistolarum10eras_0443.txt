THE DONATION TO GOCLENIUS 407

to Goclenius. Correspondence on t-he subject had passed between
Goclenius and Amerbach in August and September 1536 (A 3,
A13, A14). But Goclenius had been unaccountably dilatory;
and at his death the bulk of the monies deposited in Brabant
remained unexpended. On 7 April 1539 Amerbach, as ‘haeres'
under Erasmus’ will, addressed to the University of Louvain
a letter (A 4) giving them full powers to dispose of Erasmus’
monies in accordance with the terms of the will. This letter was
read to the University on 7 June; but in view of pending litigation
remained unanswered unt-il 15 Oct. (A 6). The University was per-
mitted by the imperial fiscal procurator to sequester the property
until a suit for the possession of it had been decided by the Council
of Brabant. There were three claimants: the University of Louvain,
Goclenius’ family, and the Treasury of Brabant. The Treasury of
Brabant contended that Erasmus' will had no validity in Brabant,
since he was illegitimate, and had not procured a licence to make
a will from the duke of Brabant, the licence which he had pro-
cured from the Emperor being deemed insufficient (A 9).1 The
claim of the Treasury, however, was set aside by a decision of the
Council of Brabant. According to Altenanus (A 10) the burden
of the suit, and its costs, were borne by Goelenius' family. In the
account given by the University to Amerbach (A 9), we are asked
to believe that the University and the family of Goclenius worked
together in the matter. According to Altenanus, the court gave
judgement to the effect that the monies deposited with Goelenius
belonged to him in virtue of a gift from Erasmus 3 this gift being
a donatio inter viuos et ex causa (see Diqest 39. 5. 3), the decisive
document being, presumably, Ep. 2863. This is not entirely con—
sonant with the version given by the University (A 9); where it
is said that Ep. 2863 was adduced by Goclenius' family only after
the claim of the Treasury had been defeated by the assistance of
the University. However this may be, the judgement of the
Council terminated the power given to the University to sequester
Erasmus' monies; and Goclenius' family supposed themselves to
be now entitled to receive these as his heirs. But the University
contrived to secure an ‘arrest’ (A 9); setting up the contentiori
that the donatio was ‘fictitious ', and that the letter attesting it
(Ep. 2863) was from the beginning understood both by Erasmus
and by Goclenius to be, not a deed of gift, but a deed creating
a trust. On 15 Oct. they wrote to Amerbach a letter (A (³)
carried by their notary, Jodocus Grimberga (called by Amerbach
in A3 ‹Judocus Gravimberga), in which they asked Amerbach to
send to Louvain any documentary evidence which he might have
tending to prove that the donatio of 1533 was ‘fictitious⁷. To
this letter Amerbach replied by a letter written on, or before,
17 Nov. (A 7). With his letter he sent copies of the documents

¹ Altenanus believed that the inus* autograpli among Goelenius'
Treasury derived their information paperS. What he says of this docu-
about Erasmus' illegitimate birth ment is of importanvo. in view of tho
from the Compendium Vitae (vol. i, doubts which have been onst 011 its
pp. 47—52)‚ which was found in Eras- authenticity (sec Appendix 1).
