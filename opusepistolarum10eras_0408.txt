2918. To GEORGE AGRICOLA.

Zwiekau Rathsschulbibliothek MS. xxxvi, Freiburg.
p. 217 b. <c. April init.> 1534.

[The 101101 was printed by Georg Buchwald in the Zeitschrist s. kirchlz'che
Wissenschast und kirchlz'ches Leben, v. Jahrgang, 1884, p. 56, from a copy
made by one of 1110 secretaries of Stephan Roth (1492-1546, 0 pupil of George
Agricola), preserved in the Rathsschulbibliothek at Zwickau. Roth’s copy
we have not been able to see, but Dr. Otto Clemen has kindly collated it
for us.

The mouth-date may be inferred from the mention of Luther's letter to
Amsdorf Epistolae Domini Nicolaz' Amsrlorfii et D. *Martini Luthe'ri, de Erasmo
Rolerodamo, VVsttenberg, Io. Lufft, 1534 (LE2. 2156); we know that a printed
copy 01 this was in the hands 01 Witzel 011 22 March 1534, see WE. e. Erasmus'
answer Purqatio adu. epist. . . . Luffieri, published by Froben, is dated April
1534, but in the present letter Erasmus says that he has no intention of
replying to Luther. The Purgatio was sent to Bernard of Cles on 12 May
(see Ep. 2941).

Α111οί1011, 111 the letter to Luther (LE2. 2140) printed with Luther's reply,
had urged Luther (who was credited with the intention of writing against
VVitzel) tolea've Witzel alone: VVitzelisa 111010 · fur Erasmi’.alreadysufficiently
refuted by Luther's Von der Wz'nlselmesse unc! Pfaffcnu·eilzc (sce Ep. 2906. 1111) ;
what is important 10 to depict Erasmus in his true colours, the friend of princes
and bishops and the recipient of gold cups. Luther's reply is 0 piece of
masterly invective. The occasion seems 10 be derived, as Erasmus suggests
(l. 9), from the De Symbolo, a work which Luther designates ⁵ artificio plane
Satanico compositum '. Erasmus is characterized. in general, as a ‘ madman'
(delirus) and a viper. But the main emphasis is laid on his love of equivoca-
tion : ‘At noster rex Amphibolus sedet in throno Amphibologiae securus'.
It is interesting that, in this letter Luther traces the beginnings 01 1110 aliena-
tion from Erasmus 10 0 sentence 111 0110 01 1110 Prcfaces to the New Testament
(the Paraclcsis).]
