APPENDIX XXII
THE cfoiillwxnlffll HJJE'PORICES

IN August 1544 Rutger Roscius printed at Louvain a booklet
of fifteen pages bearing the title Des. Erus. Rotemd. Compendz'am
Rhetoricae, ad Damianum a cloes, Equitem Lusitanum. It is
described on the title-page as Nunc primum in lacem editum, and
is prcfaccd by a letter to (joes fron] Bernartius Tiletanus (William
Bernaerts of Thielt, for whom see MHL4. p. (290), explaining
the circumstances in which the booklet was published. Explana-
tion was certainly needed: for, as Bernartius admits, Erasmus
had, in one of his letters, expressly forbidden publication (schedas
suas edi retusum there could be no publication, he had said, nisi
cum ‘magma nominis sui dedecore . . . adeo vt, 3ιῖ quis inimicus sit
capitalis, rnon possit facere inimicius. The letter of which Bernar-
tius speaks is, without doubt, Ep. 2987, where Erasmus writes to
Goes: ‘Si mihi capitalis esses inimicus, non potes quicquam
facere inimicius quam si schedas, quas vni tibi notaui, patiaris
excudi'. In a later letter, which Bernartius does not mention
(Ep. 3019), Erasmus repeats the prohibition. In excuse of publi—
cation Bernartius pleads the publio good (ἡ κοινὴ ὠφέλεια); the
Compendiam is too good, or at any rate too useful, to be kept
from the world. In the University of Louvain—at least in the
College in which Bernartius taught, the College of the Castle—
Rhetoric had to be learnt in a hurry (lines 4—10); it had less
importance than in the Italian universities For anyone learning
rhetoric in a hurry, the compendium is commended as the ideal
‘cram-book'. There are no good text-books, of a reasonable
compass, says Bernartius3 and the Compendium is one which can
safely be recommended to any lecturer (quae luto praeleyi possit).

Bernartius protests too much. It is doubtful whether the
Compendium can ever have been of real use to anyone except
Erasmus, and, through Erasmus, to Goes. It seems to embody
the Notes which Erasmus used in teaching Goes the elements of
Rhetoric‘it is conceivable that the Notes were originally made
at a much earlier period, eg. in Erasmus' Paris period, when he
had to give elementary instruction: it is difficult to credit him,
in 1534, with any fresh interest in Rhetoric. But the Notes
themselves cannot be thought useful—for the most part, indeed,
they are not intelligible—except as expounded and amplified by
a teacher or lecturer; or to a student who, using them, recalled
the exposition given by his teacher. Neither in substance, again,
nor in method and arrangement, is there novelty or originality—
the earlier sections are derived from the Ad Herennium, perhaps
directly. Nothing about the book, in fact, is interesting except
