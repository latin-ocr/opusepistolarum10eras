PREFACE

HE war of 1914-18 set a gap of nine years between the third

and fourth volumes of this edition. That the present volume
should follow Volume IX at an interval of three years only is a
circumstance which could not have been predicted; and, indeed,
it hardly lay within our hopes. But the Delegates of the Clarendon
Press have been able to do what, if they had been unwilling to do
it, we could not have asked of them. The first proofs of Volume X
came to us in August 1939 ; and throughout the first thirteen months
of the war the dispatch of copy and the receipt of proofs proceeded
with a regularity hardly less than that of the times of peace.
Before the end of September 1940 the whole volume was in type.
Such progress would have been impossible but for work already
done by P. S. Allen. All the letters, with one exception,l had been
collected by him; most of them are printed in the order in which
he arranged them. To several letters he had written introductions
(marked in this volume with his initials). The notes also owe a
great deal to his Note-books.

Since June 1940 the continent of Europe has been closed to us;
and it has not been possible to follow our former practice of col-
lating the proofs with the originals. The loss has been mitigated‚
to some extent, by the large number of photographic reproductions
which we now possess. For the photograph of Ep. 2745 we are
indebted to the courtesy of the Bibliotheque Royale de Belgique.
For that of Ep. 2806 from the Landesbibliothek of Stuttgart, we
have to thank Dr. W. Hoffmann, the librarian.

The war has deprived us of the help given to us over a long period
of years in the University Library of Basle; where the experience
and skill of Dr. Roth, keeper of the MSS„ and of Dr. Hartmann‚
editor of the Amorbachiana‚ were always at our disposal. Letters
received from Basle in June 1940 reported that Dr. Roth had died
unexpectedly on 21 May. To Dr. Roth this edition owes more
than can be told. He spent his gifts in helping others. ‘Haben
Sie einen Wunsch‚ Herr Doktor?' was his constant inquiry: and
any difficulty was at once overcome by reference to manuscript
sources or to rare books. His knowledge of his native Basle was
unrivalled. He not only gave us of his time in the Library, but
he guided us to sites in and around the city connected with Erasmus
and his contemporaries. His last letter conveyed permission to see
some Basle MSS. which the war had consigned to a remote hiding-
place—for this permission we thank Dr. Schwarber, tho Oberbiblio-
thekar; though events have made it impossible for us to profit by
it. Dr. Hartmann has given us help throughout the volume, both

¹ Erasmus' letter to James v (Ep. 2886), found by ΜΓ. R. H. Hannav iu a

ltetter-book belonging to Lt.-Col. Cuninghmno, and kiudly communicated
o us.
