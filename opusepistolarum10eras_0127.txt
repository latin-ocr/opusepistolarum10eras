2715. FROM GEORGE WrrZEL.

Leipzig MS. Frankfort.
WE. EeV0. 8 September 1532.
EE. 178.

{An original letter. autograph throughout. It was published by Witzel in
his Epistolarum . . . Libri Qualiter Georyii Wz'celii, Leipzig, N. XVolrab, 1537.

The text of WE differs in a number of small particulars from the Ms. ς the
differenees are of a kind to suggest that Witzel improved his letter before
‘printing it. At the end of WE 13 Breue Epicedion D. Erasmz‘ Boteroclami,
Authore Ioan. nyante.

Erasmus sent no reply to this letter: and on 30 Marc-h 1533 Witzel wrote
again (Ep. 2786). But his second letter also remained unanswered. Witzel
mentions tho first letter in a letter of 8 Jan. 1533 to Ὀ. S.' (WE Hh iiV0):
‘ Scripsi Erasmov pure Theologorum principi, in idem argumentum e nundinis
Francofordiensibus. Nam is vir hae in 10, vt nemo, orbi prodesse poterit.'
He mentions the ses-ond letter in a letter to Nausea of 8 June 1533 (WE
Kkvbo.): ‘ Eras. Rote. bis invitaui vt orationis suae efficaoia persuaderet
Monarchis de cogendo eoncilio'. For Erasmus' reason for not answering
Witzel‘s letters see Ep. 2918. 611.

George Witzol (XVieelius), 1501-1573, was born at Vacha on the Werra. He
was at 3011001 at Sehmalkalden. Eisenaoh, and Halle. In 1516 he went to
the university of Erfflrt, where 110 remained for two years. taking his BA.
degree. Leaving Erfurt. he was sor two years a schoolmastor in his native
Vaeha. In 1520 he spent six months in VVittenberg. where he adopted
reformed opinions. In the same year he was ordained priest, residing in
Vaeha till 1524 when he married. His marriage brought him into connexion
with Jacob Strauss: and he became minister at Wenigen-Lupnitz (near
Eisenaeh). Failing 10 give satisfaction there, he was appointed minister at
Niemegk, near VVittenberg, by Luther‘s influence. From 1525 to 1531 110
remained in Nieinegk, using the Library there for 1110 study of the Fathers
and of the works of Erasmus. In 1520 110 0011111101οἂ a sriendship with John
Campanus. which brought him under a suspicion of heresy, and eaused him
10 be arrested and for a short 111110 imprisoned. In 1531 110 resigned his
office in Niemegk. His studies there had alienated him from Lutheranism.
In particular, the Lutheran reject-ion of good works came to appear to him
false in theory and. in practice, 1110 rause of the failure of the reforming
movement. Luther had failed because good works wore absent from 1110
lives of his followers (a favourite thesis of Erasmus). ln 1533,11(-001(1111111)·,
Witzel published Pro defensione bonorum operum aduersus nouos ezeanqelistas
