THE COMPENDIUM RHETORICES 397

that it was put together by Erasmus. Bernartius and Rescius
could rely on the name of Erasmus to sell the book 2 and it may
be suspected that this was their primary concern.

For the circumstances under which the Compendium came to
light we have only the account of Bernartius. On some day not
specified Rutger Rescius took him to his study, where he showed
him, first, a collection of unprinted letters addressed to Goes by
distinguished scholars, and finally ‘a book written in the hand of
the great Erasmus ³, containing, in addition to various letters of
Erasmus to Goes the Compendinm. That the Compendizwn was
in Erasmus* autograph is implied, though not stated definitely.
It may be noted tha-t, of Erasmus' letters to Goes, none is extant
in autograph.

The Compendium has survived, so far as we know, in a single
complete copy, belonging to the Koninklijke Nederlandsche
Akademie van Wetenschappen in Amsterdam. We are indebted
to the Librarian of the Akademie for a photograph of its fifteen
pages; from which the text here given is set up. For an in-
complete copy described by Prof. de Vocht, see MHL⁴¹.‚ pp. 693—4.
The prefatory letter of Bernartius was printed in Opus Epistolarum
Latinarum Damiam' de Goes by ·J. de Vasconcellos, who presum-
ably knew a complete copy. The existence of the book was
known to P. S. Allen, and we were enabled‚ through the kindness
of Prof. Roersch‚ to discover its present location. The booklet, and
indeed the very name of it, has hitherto been unknown to the
bibliographers3 and if, four centuries ago, it could not be printed
‘nisi cum magno nominis Erasmi dedecore', it seems harmless
to-day to rescue it· from oblivion.
