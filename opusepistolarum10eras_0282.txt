scire volui, vir amicissime, vt si quid forte fuci subsit in hoc
negotio, deprehendas et corrigas.

Ante paucos dies scripsi ad te per Petrum Montfortium, sed

laetiora, quum volet. Vbi conualuero, gratias agam benignitati
patriae. Ex oratione Petri cognom, quantum tibi debeam. Vtinam
aliqua cx parte referre liceat. Cupio te cuin omnibus tibi charis
quani prosperrime valere.

[The idea of returning to Brabant had been present to Erasmus' mind in
the years immediately following his settlement in Basle. In the spring of
1522 110 had in fact undertaken the journey north, but was recalled by ill-
health; see Ep. 1273 introd. In the year following Quecn Margaret, the
Regma, pressed strongly for his return; sec Ep. 1408. 1111.

After leaving Basle for Freiburg. Erasmus, as early as 1530, seems again to
have considered seriously the question of going back to the Low Countries;
see Ep. 2410. 52n. The project is referred to. in a number of letters of 1531
and 1532. It had the warm support not only of Olah, but of Carondelet. see
Epp. 2603, 2689; and in March 1533 both of them took the matter up
earnestly. On 27 March Carondelet, in reply to Erasmus' request (Ep. 2762.
13-6), sent an official letter of invitation. Ep. 2784. The Emperor's sanction
was required, and from OE. p. 354 we learn that Olah had written to the
Emperor's semetary, Nic. Grudius, soliciting approval. On 4 May Grudius
replied from Spain that the Emperor favoured the plan and had written to
the Queen; Granvelle at the same time wrote to Carondelet (OE. p. 361).
By June 1533 the project seemed to be sufficiently advanced tojustify sending
Livinus Algoet to Freiburg: he carried with him money for Erasmus' journey.
The present letter, together with Epp. 2822, 2828, was broughtv by him.
Livinus returned to Brabant, and it was understood that Erasmus would
shortly follow. But despite these preparations Erasmus’ health was found
to make the projected journey impracticable: see Epp. 2850, 2860. At the
end of August Erasmus writing to Boniface (Ep. 2865) speaks of the matter
as postponed to the spring. In June 1534 we find Olah still pressing Erasmus
to return3 OE. p. 509.]
