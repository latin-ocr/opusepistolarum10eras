[For the mouth-date see Ep. 2796 introd.

No other correspondence survives between Erasmus and Colster, but the
tone of this letter seems to show intimacy. In Ep. 2645 Erasmus tells
Sasbout that the urgency of the messenger prevents him from writing to
Colster; and in a letter of Aug. 1535 (Basle MS. Goclenii Ep. 9) Goelenius
mentions Colster among the ‘ proceres Hollandiae ’ present at a dinner-party.

Abel, or Aelbert, van de Coulster, son of Ysbrand van de Coulster treasurer
of Dordrecht, was born at Dordrecht c. 1468. Of noble family and a knight,
he became in 1503 Councillor in ordinary of the Court of Holland3 in 1510 he
was made extraordinary Councillor by Maximilian3 but at his own request
was restored to the position of ordinary Councillor in 1516, retaining that
office till 1534. (The Court of Holland, instituted by Philip the Good, was
the central organization of government, and at once a Council of State and
a supreme Court of Justice.)

Fredericq iv, p. 184, prints from the Ryijksarchief at the Hague a passage
referring to Colster: ‘ Master (a legal title) Abel van Coulster, ordinary coun-
cillor, and Philips van Vuytwyck, secretary of the said Court, by order and
command of the said Court travelled from the Hague on the 6111 day of May
1523 to the town of Woerden, where the bench of the bishopric of Utrecht
had also been convened’, for the purpose of taking information about a
woman suspected of Lutheran leanings.

Henne vi, p. 15, refers to a document (unspecified) in the Archives du
royaurne containing ⁶ Instructions donnees a maitre Abel de Coe-stre conseiller,
et Pierre de saint-Pierre, secretaire de la cour de Hollande‚ envoyes a la
reine regente par le Comte d'Hoogstraeten, 14 May 1532 ³. The Regent was
solicited for aid against the Hanseatic towns.

Colster married Maria Longyn; he died in 1540.
See BWN. s.v. Coulster.]
